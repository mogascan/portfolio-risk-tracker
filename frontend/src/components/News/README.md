# Social Feed Component Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
We identified and fixed several issues with the Social Feed component:

1. **Naming Inconsistency**: There was a mismatch between component names and filenames
   - `SocialFeed.js` contained a component named `XSocialFeed`
   - `XFeedContainer.jsx` was importing `XSocialFeed` from `./SocialFeed`

2. **Categories Not Loading**: Categories were possibly not being loaded correctly from localStorage

3. **API Connectivity**: Unable to verify if the X/Twitter API was properly connected

## Our Fixes

### 1. Fixed Naming Inconsistency
- Renamed the component in `SocialFeed.js` to match its filename (`XSocialFeed` → `SocialFeed`)
- Updated import statements in:
  - `XFeedContainer.jsx` to import from `SocialFeed.js`
  - `NewsFeed.js` to use `XFeedContainer` instead of direct `SocialFeed` usage

### 2. Added Debugging Tools
- Added debug logs to `SocialFeed.js` and `XSocialFeed.js` to track category data
- Created `FixCategoriesPage.jsx` as a dedicated debug page with:
  - One-click category reset
  - API connectivity testing
  - Environment variable checking

### 3. Environment Variables
- Created a sample `.env` file with the necessary X/Twitter API credentials

## How To Use

### To Fix Categories
1. Navigate to the FixCategoriesPage component
2. Click "Reset Categories to Default"
3. Go back to the main app to verify categories are now showing

### To Test API Connectivity
1. Navigate to the FixCategoriesPage component
2. Update your `.env` file with real API credentials
3. Click "Test API Connection" to verify connectivity
4. Use "Check Environment Variables" to ensure all required variables are set

### For Developers
Review the debug logs in the browser console to understand:
- What categories are being received by the components
- Whether localStorage is being accessed correctly
- If API connectivity is established

## Component Structure

```

├── SocialFeed.js       - UI component for Social Feed
├── XSocialFeed.js      - Copy of UI component to resolve import issues
├── XFeedContainer.jsx  - Container with business logic and API integration
├── xApiService.js      - Service for interacting with X/Twitter API
├── CategoriesDebug.jsx - Tool for debugging category issues
├── TestCategories.js   - Simple test component for category management
├── FixCategoriesPage.jsx - All-in-one fix and debug page
└── index.js            - Entry point that exports components
```

## Common Issues

### No Categories Appearing
- Try resetting categories using the FixCategoriesPage
- Check browser console for any localStorage errors
- Verify the localStorage key matches between components (`x_social_feed_categories`)

### API Not Connected
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly in `.env`
- Make sure you have valid API credentials from Twitter/X
- Use the API connectivity test on the FixCategoriesPage

### Import Errors
- All imports should now use the correct paths and component names
- If you encounter a "Cannot find module" error, check the file paths
