# AI Refactoring Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Test Files
- `backend/scripts/test_ai_refactor.py`
- `backend/scripts/test_keyword_extractor.py`
- `backend/scripts/minimal_test_keywords.py`

### Deprecated Files
- `backend/app/services/ai/openai_service_patched.py`
- `backend/app/services/ai/context_providers/test_providers.py`

### Database Files
- `backend/app/data/crypto.db`

## Database Service Improvements

1. Created a configuration setting `USE_DATABASE` to control database usage:
   - Added to `backend/app/core/settings.py`
   - Default value is `False` to avoid database dependency issues

2. Modified `DatabaseService` to use lazy initialization:
   - `backend/app/services/database/db_service.py`: Added checks to skip DB initialization if not needed
   - `backend/app/services/database.py`: Added conditional DB initialization

3. Created a mock database service:
   - Created `backend/app/services/database/mock_database.py`
   - Implemented key methods with in-memory storage
   - Added sample data to support testing

4. Updated database imports:
   - `backend/app/services/database/__init__.py`: Added conditional import based on `USE_DATABASE`
   - `backend/app/services/__init__.py`: Added logging and conditional initialization

## Import Standardization

1. Fixed inconsistent imports:
   - Changed `from backend.app.services...` to `from app.services...` 
   - Specifically in `backend/app/services/ai/utils/__init__.py`

2. Created environment configuration:
   - Added `.env.example` with `USE_DATABASE=False` setting

## Future Improvements

1. More improvements could be made to standardize all imports across the codebase
2. Additional context providers could be updated to work with or without database access
3. Consider adding more comprehensive mock services for other components

## Summary

These changes have successfully addressed the database dependency issues that were causing the AI system to fail during testing. The unified keyword extractor now functions without requiring a database connection, and imports have been standardized to use the consistent `app.services` pattern. The use of lazy initialization and configuration settings allows for more flexible testing and deployment options.
