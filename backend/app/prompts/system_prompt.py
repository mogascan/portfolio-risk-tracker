4. News Feeds

  b. Macro/finance news
  c. Reddit social sentiment
- News relevance is tied to asset full names and categories

5. AI Chat Interface

- Guide the user through understanding different pages, tools, or data views

If something is not available or data is missing, respond clearly without hallucinating.
